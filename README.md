# Snake Game Backend
This is the backend of my [snake game](https://chrismenke45.github.io/snake_client) I made with Ruby on Rails to save highscores. The frontend made with React can be seen [here](https://github.com/chrismenke45/snake_client)

## How it's made:
Tech used: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL
## Optimizations
I could have put some more secuity on this api. It is set to only allow requests from the frontend url, but could use some more secuirty, implimenting CSRF tokens would be a good idea.
## Lessons Learned
This is the first Rails/Postgres backend I deployed so I had to find a good hosting platform (Fly.io).
